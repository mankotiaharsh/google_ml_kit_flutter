Text Recognizer and Summarizer using google_ml_kit in Flutter
This Flutter application leverages the power of Google's ML Kit to provide two key functionalities: text recognition and text summarization. The app uses the google_ml_kit package to accurately recognize text from images, making it easy to extract text from various sources such as documents, signs, and handwritten notes.

Once the text is recognized, the app also includes a built-in text summarizer that condenses large bodies of text into concise summaries, making it easier to digest and understand the main points.

Features:
Text Recognition: Capture images or upload them from your gallery to recognize and extract text with high accuracy.
Text Summarization: Automatically generate summaries from recognized text, saving time and effort in reading.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for seamless user experience.
Technologies Used:
Flutter: The app is built using Flutter for a cross-platform experience.
google_ml_kit: Google's powerful ML Kit for text recognition and processing.
This project serves as a robust tool for anyone needing quick and efficient text extraction and summarization on the go.
