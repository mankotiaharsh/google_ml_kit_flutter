# Flutter App: Text Recognizer and Text Summarizer using 'google_ml_kit'

This Flutter application demonstrates the use of Google’s ML Kit to implement two essential functionalities: text recognition and text summarization. The app is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, offering a seamless user experience across two main screens:

# Features:
# Text Recognizer (Screen 1):
- Users can capture images using the camera or upload images from their device's gallery.
- The app then recognizes and extracts text from the images with high accuracy using google_ml_kit.

# Text Summarizer (Screen 2):
- Once the text is recognized, users can navigate to the summarizer screen.
- The summarizer condenses large bodies of text into concise and meaningful summaries, making it easier to grasp the core message.

# Technologies Used:
- Flutter: The app is developed using Flutter, ensuring a cross-platform, high-performance experience.
- google_ml_kit: Leveraging Google’s ML Kit to handle the complex tasks of text recognition and text summarization.

# Project Structure:
- Screen 1: Implements the Text Recognizer functionality.
- Screen 2: Implements the Text Summarizer functionality.

This project serves as a practical example for developers looking to integrate Google’s ML Kit into their Flutter applications, especially for tasks involving text processing.
